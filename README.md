# UFOs

## Overview

This analysis created a webpage that allows users to browse tabular data on UFO sightings and to filter the data based on one or more  of the following criteria:  

Date of the sighting  
City  
State  
Country  
Shape of the UFO  
 
## Results

When opening the webpage the user will see header information and introductory text at the top, a set of five filter boxes on the left hand side, and a table of information on UFO sightings in the lower right.

To perform a search on the webpage users simply enter search criteria in one or more of the filter boxes at the left hand side of the page.

An example of a simple search is to filter for UFO sightings in the state of California (ca). Simply type the letters "ca" in the "Enter State" box and press return:

Note that now the table only displays table entries with "ca" in the "State" column.

To refine the preceding search the user can enter a value in another filter box. In the image below, they have entered the date "1/1/2010"

Note that now the table only displays UFO sightings in California on 1/1/2010.

A final example is to refine the previous search for a specific UFO shape; a triangle.

This query shows us that in the state of California on New Year's Day of 2010, there were five seaparate sightings of triangle shaped UFOs, in four different cities, lasting from 1 to 12 minutes.

To launch a new search the user deletes the text previously entered in the filter boxes, restoring the webpage to the original view with the complete table of UFO sightings visible.

## Summary

Three recommended improvements to this webpage are:  

1) The current webpage requires users to manually delete their filter criteria to return to the original view. A "Search Reset" button should be added to allow users to quickly remove their filters.  

2) The current webpage requires users to manually scroll the entire table of UFO sightings to examine the range of available values for the various filters. Adding pulldown lists to each filter box would allow the user to quickly select filter criteria without having to inspect the table to understand what search values are available.

3) The current webpage restricts users employing the date filter to selecting a single day of UFO sightings. Adding a second filter box for an end date would allow users to filter UFO sightings over a range of dates.
