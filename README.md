## Summary

Two recommended improvements to this webpage are:

1) The current webpage requires users to manually delete their filter criteria to return to the original view. A "Search Reset" button should be added to allow users to quickly remove their filters.  

2) The current webpage requires users to manually scroll the entire table of UFO sightings to examine the range of available values for the various filters. Adding pulldown lists to each filter box would allow the user to quickly select filter criteria without having to inspect the table.
